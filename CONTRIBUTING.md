# Contributing
I welcome contribution! If you believe you have something to contribute to this project, please consider contributing using the following guidelines.

- Be respectful of everyone and their contributions.
- Use proper English. I currently do not understand any other languages and I am far less likely to support your ideas if I can't understand you.
- Try to be constructive. Rather than denying anyone's ideas, listen to them and try to elaborate and improve on it.
- Despite being a mod about garments, perverted ideas will immediately be rejected. This includes porn, private parts and anything sexual.

## Issues
Adding to or creating an issue is one of the most effective ways you can contribute. If you have any questions, concerns or ideas, please do not hesitate to create an issue.

- No idea is too stupid! If you believe an idea has value, say something. It is far better to have an issue closed than it is to miss a potentially great idea!
- Avoid creating a wall of test. Use headings when applicable and consider including a summary.
- Use emphesis sparingly. **If everything is bold, nothing is!**

## Pull requests
Starting a pull request is the most direct way you can contribute and the fastest way you can get your feature available for everyone.

- Before creating a pull request, create an issue to discuss your proposed changes! This gives the community a chance to properly provide feedback, point out duplicate or similar features and requirements (reducing the chance of your request being rejected).
- Your change must not break existing features, harm users or do anything the community would deem malicious.
- I may expect you to make changes before your request is accepted for any reason.
- If you wish to be attributed for your work, please add your name to the mods.toml and README.md file.
- By creating a pull request, you agree to have your contribution sublicensed under the Minecraft Mod Public License (as described in LICENSE.md).

### Code standards
- When in doubt, follow the common approach used by the mod, Forge or Minecraft.
- Use tabs for indentation. Spaces may be used for alignment.
- Opening braces should be on the same line as the opening statement.
  `if (true) {`
- Build on existing classes in ca.cjloewen.base when applicable.
- Changes to the base package should be requested separately under these same guidelines (https://github.com/cloewen8/MBM).
