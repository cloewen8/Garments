# Garments
Garments is a mod for Minecraft that adds garments and garment related features.

This mod is in early development. If you have any questions, concerns or problems
with it, please open an issue.

## **DISCLAIMER**
This mod is incredibly outdated and was started back when I was new to modding.

I still want to finish it, however at this point it easier to just start over.

- Everything is outdated.
- I have since learned a lot!
- I believe Fabric would be a better framework than Forge to make this.
  Forge is great for extending Minecraft, but a lot of my ideas require
  changing core mechanics.

Source installation information for modders
-------------------------------------------
This code follows the Minecraft Forge installation methodology. It will apply
some small patches to the vanilla MCP source code, giving you and it access 
to some of the data and functions you need to build a successful mod.

Note also that the patches are built against "unrenamed" MCP source code (aka
srgnames) - this means that you will not be able to read them directly against
normal code.
